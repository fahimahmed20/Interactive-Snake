ðŸŽ¨ Add interactive SVG snake animation with gradient visuals

Implemented a fully responsive SVG-based snake animation that follows the pointer movement.

Designed the snake using <defs> with separate head and segment components, using linear gradients for a realistic effect.

Included smooth motion logic using JavaScript with easing and tail-follow behavior.

Optimized responsiveness by handling window resizing.

Ensured performance with requestAnimationFrame and minimal recalculations.

Ideal for creative web experiments, backgrounds, or interactive UI elements.
